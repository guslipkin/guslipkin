## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™ve always loved asking â€˜how?â€™ and â€˜why?â€™ Since starting my journey as a data scientist, Iâ€™ve been able to answer â€˜how?â€™ by developing tools to support my teammates, while answering â€˜why?â€™ with analyses to support data driven decision making. Iâ€™m looking for a position where I can build a career using my skills to help my team and conduct meaningful analyses that inform business decisions and contribute to achieving company goals.

If you want to learn more about me, feel free to poke around [my site](https://guslipkin.me) to learn more about what I do or to contact me directly.
