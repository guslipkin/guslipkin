## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™ve always loved asking â€˜how?â€™ and â€˜why?â€™ Since starting my journey as a data scientist, Iâ€™ve been able to answer â€˜how?â€™ by architecting long-term reporting solutions and developing tools to support my teammates, while answering â€˜why?â€™ with analyses to support data driven decision making. Iâ€™m looking for a position where I can put my skills to the test and help answer my two favorite questions.

If you want to learn more about me, feel free to poke around [my site](https://guslipkin.me) to learn more about what I do or to contact me directly.
